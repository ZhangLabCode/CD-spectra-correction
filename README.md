This repository contains a Python GUI application for wavelength-resolved correction of circular dichroism (CD) spectra using a multi-concentration least-squares approach 

The program requires an Excel file containing a Wavelength column, paired CD_XK_1…N columns (which must already be K-factor normalized, i.e., CD_XK = CD_X(λ)/K), and matching E_T_1…N columns. After launching the script (python CD-correction_Final.py) and installing the required packages (numpy, pandas, matplotlib, openpyxl), the user loads the Excel file, selects the sheet, inputs the concentration factors C₁…Cₙ, confirms K-normalization, and runs the solver. At each wavelength, the software simultaneously determines the intrinsic CD(λ) and the ratio Is(λ)/I0(λ), reconstructs calculated CD_XK spectra, evaluates residuals, and provides numerical diagnostics (rank, condition number, RMS residual) to assess stability. Results can be exported to a structured Excel file containing solved parameters, model predictions, residuals, and per-sample derived quantities, making the workflow suitable for quantitative correction of scattering-affected CD measurements in multi-sample datasets
